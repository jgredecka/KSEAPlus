<h2>Welcome to KSEAPlus!</h2>
<br>
<p class="p-border">KSEAPlus is a computational tool designed for the inference of kinase activity based on the kinase substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) methods. Currently, KSEAPlus features an implementation of a number of KSEA algorithms that have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The algorithms include a Z-test based on the Z-score transformation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and KARP (Kinase Activity Ranking using Phosphoproteomics data) algorithm.  </p>
